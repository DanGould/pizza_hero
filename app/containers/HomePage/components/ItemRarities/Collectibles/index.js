        No more churning through hundreds of packs looking for that last hero to
        complete your collection. Buy and sell heroes, chests, and more with
        other players, or trade amongst your friends - we canâ€™t stop you.
        Powered by the Tron Network, ownership history and scarcity are
        permanently etched into the blockchain for all to witness.
        <br />
        <br />
        We will never compete with player-sold heroes: once we stop selling an
        item it can only be acquired through the player marketplace.
